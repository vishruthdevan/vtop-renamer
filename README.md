# vtop-renamer
A python script to rename lecture notes for courses in my university to a more readable naming format. Files are chronologically ordered based on the date present in the name of each file.

### Usage:
1. Download the executable vtop-renamer.exe from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/vishruthdevan/vtop-renamer/releases) and run it  
2. Enter the path(without quotation marks) to the zip file or to the directory that contains the already extracted notes  
3. The notes after renaming will be saved in the same directory or the directory with the same name as the .zip file
